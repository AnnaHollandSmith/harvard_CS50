# Harvard CS50

[Week 0](./resources/week_0) | [Week 1](./resources/week_1)

CS50 (aka CS50x through edX) is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

I will use this repository to record my progress through the course, for showing my responses to class assignments and keeping relevant notes or resources.

A list of additional resources and links used throughout the course can be found [here](./resources/Links.md)
